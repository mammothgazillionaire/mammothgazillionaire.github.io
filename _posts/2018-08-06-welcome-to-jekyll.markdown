Learning to code is just like learning a new language.

To learn a language you need to first understand what a language is.
A language is a combination of grammar, vocabulary, structuring, and syntax.
With all that you can get down to basics or maybe somewhere make you familiar with it but you are not there yet, where you easily understand it and respond.
For that, you need to first learn to destructure it and reassemble in the way you understand better and than go on what it actually means.

#### There are a few major factors that play a key role in learning a language:

## Environment

Assume this if you are learning to speak Latin but others around you are learning to speak german both languages are different.
If you interact with others with them it will sound gibberish for you, it will be the same but if you are in a place everyone is learning to speak Latin.

It will not just help you learn the language but understand it better and your progress will be escalated.

## Community

community is a group of people with common interest where everyone has only one focus, if it's about coding everyone will only think, talk and interact about coding and yeah there is other stuff so its not like people have it for breakfast or something like that but community is like a family everyone is working for the same thing, share the same interest, help each other and pushing each other.
Now your progress is skyrocketing.


## Mentor

A Mentor is a trending word these days.
A mentor is an experienced and trusted adviser, that's what Google says.
But a mentor is more than that he is like a guru or more like a friend who is definitely more experienced in all sorts of way but he is also helping you out with problems, guiding you and hanging out together discussing problems, solving problems and having fun.


## Practice, Practice, Practice

The more you practice the better you will be and you will become good at it,
it will be more like a habit and you will keep on going again and again, and you will better than yesterday.

whether it's JavaScript, C, C++ or Python, whatever language it is it takes effort and work most of it understanding, practice and going through challenges.
